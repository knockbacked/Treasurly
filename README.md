# Personal Finance Tracker

## 1. Overview
Many individuals struggle to manage their finances effectively, leading to overspending and limited savings visibility.  
The **Personal Finance Tracker** is a full-stack web application designed to centralize financial information, automate transaction categorization, and provide users with clear analytics and budgeting insights.  
It integrates a Spring Boot backend with a React + Vite frontend and a MongoDB Atlas database.

_(This project was completed as part of a university group assignment.)_

## 2. System Architecture
The system follows a client–server model with RESTful communication.

- **Frontend:** React (Vite + TypeScript)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java 17)
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (cloud)
- **Communication:** JSON over HTTP
- **Authentication:** Session-based using Spring Security
- **Testing & Coverage:** JUnit 5 + JaCoCo (HTML and XML reports)

```
frontend/  → React + Vite interface
backend/   → Spring Boot REST API + MongoDB integration
```

- **Session-based authentication** using `HttpSession`  
- **Check authentication status** (`/api/users/check`)  
- **Retrieve current user** (`/api/users/me`)

### Transaction Management
- **CRUD operations** for transactions (create, read, update, delete)  
- **Filter by category, type, or user**  
- **Logging for transaction events**

### Budget Management
- **Create, view, update, and delete budgets**  
- **Add or remove budget items** with category-based allocations  
- **Budget summaries by user**

### Category Management
- **View, create, update, and delete categories**  
- **Persistent storage in MongoDB**

### Analytics and Insights
- **Income and expense summaries** per user  
- **Net balance and projected spending (3-month projection)**  
- **Aggregated analytics accessible via `/api/analytics/summary`**

### Testing and Coverage
- **JUnit 5 test suite** for controllers and services  
- **JaCoCo coverage reporting** (HTML report generated at `build/reports/jacocoHtml`)

## 5. Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17+**
- **Node.js (v16+)**
- **MongoDB Atlas connection string** or local instance on port `27017`

### Environment Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/personal-finance-tracker.git
   cd personal-finance-tracker
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./gradlew bootRun         # For UNIX
   gradlew bootRun           # For Windows
   ```

   * Backend runs at: **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**

3. **Frontend Setup**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev-unix          # For UNIX
   npm run dev-win           # For Windows
   ```

   * Frontend runs at: **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**

> The `dev-unix` and `dev-win` scripts automatically run both frontend and backend concurrently.

## 6. Deployment Notes

* The database is deployed on **MongoDB Atlas**, providing secure cloud-based data persistence.
* Environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI) are defined in `.env` for local and cloud builds.
* For UNIX systems, ensure Gradle wrapper has execution permission:

  ```bash
  chmod +x ./gradlew
  ```
